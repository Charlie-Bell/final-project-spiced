We care about people because they are struggling to achieve something that they desperately want and the world isn't letting them have it.  The more you stomp on them, the more we will care about them.  They don't even have to be a good person.  In fact making them a bit more relatable and open to making serious mistakes in character, is something that we actually respond positively to as long as they ultimately have a good heart.  \\n\\nIf you are not putting this character through so much that you would hate to actually be here and feel badly for her, then you are not going far enough.  Step 1 in a good story is to ruin your MC's life. <|reply|> What does your MC want? And what obstacles is she battling to overcome those obstacles? There's a good [Youtube video](https://youtu.be/oFaaxc1f1-M) about making audiences empathize with screenplay characters. Show the character unjustly mistreated, neglected, betrayed, etc. Show their humanity, e.g show how they might care for the wellbeing of another person more than they care about themselves. And give them an admirable trait, like courage, or being funny.\\n\\nUnwittingly, I did all three of these to my female MC (one of two MCs). A minor character was poisoned. While the female MC is trying to get him to a doctor, she realizes she's been poisoned as well. The other person collapses on the way, and the MC isn't far from doing the same. Instead of leaving him behind, she musters the strength to carry the other person to help. The end of the chapter shows her collapsing in a hallway and passing out. I just thought it was a just cool action scene. But putting her through the wringer has made my writing group grow to love her. <|endoftext|>\",\n",

       " \"<|endoftext|> I think it is mostly a matter of market. Many publishers (really small one might be an exception) have an established market, budget and routine for publishing books and as an indie you have none of that and have to learn how to market the books yourself. There are millions of books so just publishing means nothing in the way of sales.\\n\\nI personally think the smart move is to build your career hybrid if possible by always sending your MS around and if it gets picked up in a reasonable amount of time great if not then publish under your own imprint. <|reply|> >always sending your MS around and if it gets picked up in a reasonable amount of time great if not then publish under your own imprint\\n\\nThat's exactly where I'm at right now. I mean, I'm really trying to get an agent for a novel I've finished. But, if some critical number of agents turn me down (maybe like 100 or so), I'm just going to self-publish it.  I hear some people saying that's not a good idea (presuming a novel isn't any good if no agents pick it up, and thus you'll soil your rep), but I don't believe that myth. I think tons and tons of great books fail to find publishers, for many reasons. The image of the author who pined away for years on a manuscript only to be turned down scores of times ... that's now a cliche because it actually happened so many times. For example, here's an article that lists many such cases:   [https://lithub.com/the-most-rejected-books-of-all-time/](https://lithub.com/the-most-rejected-books-of-all-time/)   The lead-off guy got 162 rejections, which is about 62 more than I think I'd wait before self-publishing.  \\n\\nIn fairness, some may argue that, if you DO self-publish and it doesn't sell well, that also tarnishes your author rep. That may be somewhat true, but only the TEXT can tarnish an author's rep, in my opinion. So, if your work is good and you can't find an outlet, I say go for it.  You can always pick up an agent on the next one, or the one after that -- whatever it takes. So much of this is luck, I think. <|endoftext|>\",\n",

As far as I\\'m concerned, everyone on either side is obviously a blithering idiot - specific tools and disciplines are best suited to determine specific things, and NO tool or discipline is capable of determining absolutely everything about any broad and nuanced topic.  Exactly as noted here, \"pluralism is crucial,\" not just regarding this topic but regarding all such topics.

There’s no neutral position from which scientists can conceptualize love; neither natural nor social scientists can stay above the philosophical fray.

People that get too focused on 'realism' lose sight of the fact that nobody wants to read about normal people doing normal things and nothing ever happens in their lives. We want to read about something that is striking; that gives us pause to stop and consider things. We want to read something that captures our imagination.\\n\\nConsider Charlize Theron.

It's fair game to bling your character up a little bit and make them stand out. <|reply|> Yeah, but it’s got to make sense, doesn’t it?  The scenario you outlined had a logical progression.  As a reader, I find that when a character has too many tragedies occur that aren’t at least related that I lose my connection to the character.  For example, if in the unlikely event that a child with leukemia growing up in poverty is kidnapped by a serial killer, assaulted, and rescued, I could believe lots of future events.  Serial killer’s kid gets fixated on the now adult victim, a copycat becomes interested, the child grows up to be a killer himself, or goes the other way and becomes an FBI agent hunting serial killlers, is neglected and never emotionally heals because his/her parents can’t afford treatment, has complications with the cancer, etc.  But if the character has unrelated bad luck later on, it becomes harder to believe. <|endoftext|>\",\n",

       " \"<|endoftext|> Editing is terrifying, one way to alleviate part of that terror is by ensuring that you always keep a copy of the unedited work.  You could also keep backups at the start of editing a new section, that way you have the option to revert, without having to try to recreate the original.\\n\\nMy preferred method of editing, and everyone has a different method that works for them, is to start with a read through of the entire thing, making notes as I go on the big picture changes that are needed.  So maybe do that first, read through with an eye to identifying those sections you know are 'utter crap'.  When you know which sections need major work first then draft new outlines and either re-write or edit as you go, depending on the depth of the changes.\\n\\nMy main plan when editing is to start with the big picture changes and in each successive pass through the document work on changes with smaller and smaller scope.  The last pass would be going sentence by sentence, but there is no point in getting individual sentences perfect until you know if they're even going to stay in the finished work.\\n\\nThen there's beta readers and more rounds of editing to come after that detailed line edit.\\n\\nThe bigger issue here though is your word count.  You describe the piece as a children's novel, I don't know if that is YA or MG or some other age group, but for any of those, 140k is far too long.  It's practically double the generally accepted maximum for YA, although you get more words if it's sci-fi or fantasy, again, I don't know which genre you're writing.  And if it's for a younger audience, as seems likely from referring to it as a children's novel, then you've probably got three times the expected maximum.\\n\\nSo, if it was me, I'd start by looking at it and deciding if it could be split into multiple books, each one complete and standalone.  If so I'd do that. If not, I'd read through the current work, and extract the barebones to make an outline and then re-write from scratch, distilling the story down to its essential elements.\\n\\nSorry, that got really long, good luck, I hope you face your fears and produce an amazing book. <|reply|> >My main plan when editing is to start with the big picture changes and in each successive pass through the document work on changes with smaller and smaller scope. The last pass would be going sentence by sentence, but there is no point in getting individual sentences perfect until you know if they're even going to stay in the finished work.\\n\\nThis is exactly what I do.\\n\\nA couple years back I wrote a manuscript by writing just 30 minutes a day. I did the same with editing, though for the first part of that, it basically just entailed reading through and writing notes down. The first draft was about 60,000 words long, which was way too short. I ended up adding almost 30,000 and rewrote some scenes along the way.\\n\\nI'm not sure about how to cut from such a long work, but I agree that it's a bit too long, especially if you're seeking first publication. 90,000 is generally the standard for commercial fiction. OP, see if you can find scenes that don't really add to the work but might include some details you can add elsewhere. See what you can remove, cut it temporarily and read the manuscript as a whole to see if it makes sense still, then you can add back what you think was completely necessary. You might also find some different scenes on your read-through that don't need to be there.\\n\\nAs to rewriting, I've done this multiple times, and the story benefited from it. In the long run, at the very least, writing your novel helps you figure out what the story is really about, and rewriting it in a way that makes the story actually work can help you in your future projects because you already have a good idea of what makes stories work in general. If you feel rewriting is the way to go, pick some scenes from the original that you think are the best if you'd like to keep them but then go back and start again from the planning phase, this time using what you know about the story to create a solid framework.\\n\\nLike Zalenkarina says, it's best to start with the big picture rather than the more granular details. A good story can be written poorly just as a weak story can be written well. If I had to choose, I'd pick the former option, but ideally you should be striving to reach a high standard of both good story and good writing. <|endoftext|>\",\n",

       " \"<|endoftext|> An em dash is sort of the opposite of parentheses. It can be used just like you have above. Its purpose is to place emphasis on the information contained within them (whereas anything placed within the parentheses is meant to be a sort of aside, or additional information). You can also use a single em dash to point to information that you provide at the end of a sentence but you still would like to highlight. E.g. The lawyer got up to make her final statement--the case hung on her ability to deliver a convincing final plea. \\nA semicolon is almost solely used to punctuate between two complete sentences (they have their own subject and predicate [verb]). It is meant to show the reader that there is a relationship between the two sentences. E.g. The blizzard had arrived; Albert felt the cold sweep through his bones. You can also do this with a conjunctive adverb thrown in (however, therefore, etc.). The semicolon can finally be used in place of a comma while listing items which contain internal commas. E.g. I visited Springfield, OH; Lincoln, NB; and Paris, TX.\\nCommas are a bit more complicated, as they serve multiple functions. Mostly they indicate a cut in the flow of the sentence (the word comes from the Greek word for cut or splice). This is sometimes interpreted as a breath, but this is not totally correct. We would usually use one after a subordinate clause that is preceding a main clause (E.g. Because I stopped for a bagel, I was late for work) whereas we don't do this if the clauses are inverted. We would also use a comma with coordinating conjunctions (FANBOYS--for, and, nor, but, or, yet, so) to separate two main clauses. Commas can also serve a sort of neutral parenthetical role as appositive phrases (E.g. My cousin Sally, a professional wrestler, just arrived from St. Louis). Finally, we use commas to list (I brought soda, chips, and chocolate to the party.), to set off names or words that begin a sentence (Wow, you are good at that!), and also to separate adjectives (the big, brown, ugly, smelly boar is charging). Ultimately, I would suggest checking out Grammar Girl's podcasts or website, or some other online resources as the rules around commas are kind of difficult (but they can be learned!). \\nHope this helps clarify things a bit for you.

Capitalize \"collision\" in \"After collision.\"\\n\\n- Don\\'t use vague descriptions. So, you say it was an unusually hot autumn. What does that mean to the reader? Only you know as an author. Don\\'t think the reader is psychic. Tell us. How hot is it? Were the flowers wilting? Were people getting sunburns? Show the hotness. Write more visually.\\n\\n- You don\\'t need to say things twice in a sentence. You don\\'t have to say she was happy. We know. It\\'s strongly implied. You say her two great pleasures are tea, and guiding her apprentices, and she did that. No need to make a summary at the end.\\n\\n> Her topic today was somewhat specialised- had the gods, including her own goddess, ever been mortals, and if so what were the further theological implications of this?

She didn\\'t know if anyone would ever see quite what her poor words were trying to say, but she felt confident she would convey the main thought.\\n\\n- You\\'re asking a question to the reader that\\'s confusing. Don\\'t do that. Don\\'t make them think of vague answer for a vague question. We don\\'t know what theological implications might be. In the beginning, you are to provide the answers.\\n\\n- Again, there\\'s vagueness. Chopped up, and arranged her thoughts? How does one visualize that? Show what that is. What\\'s she thinking that seems \"chopped up\"?\\n\\n> Arriving at the park she mounted a podium and spoke to a few dozen listeners. Even saints only attracted so many people to a thrice weekly early morning lecture. The crowd nodded politely throughout her sermon, suprised and perhaps even a little disappointed. that she had strayed from the normally practical subject matter of her teaching. Sometimes though, she reflected, a fuller context was needed for understanding- she had her reasons. She lingered to give advice to the perplexed, healing to the sick and an ear to the lonely before wandering back to ther chambers, humming and smiling.\\n\\n- Be a bit more specific. A few dozen? What\\'s a few? Say 100 or 200, but don\\'t make it a math problem. The problem with your writing is you give all these details, but they are vague. Avoid doing that. Your writing comes off as extremely passive, and it\\'s hard to make a picture of it.\\n\\n> Amber, a temple acolyte and student of Micaela sat in a bare office.

How bare? How? Does it only have white walls, and a desk?\\n\\nConclusion:\\n\\nAlright. So, I don\\'t think you\\'re a bad writer, but your writing is rather dry. You could write well, if you really tried. The problem is you give all these details, and not important details. You say something is this, or that, and then don\\'t make it clear enough that the reader can see it in his/her mind.

He took his machete to it, oh yes he diiid. Only then did I realize I’d spent a year of my life humped over a word processor when I could’ve been doing something productive, like fiddling with a fidget spinner 24/7. Instead of attempting to fix book #1 I wrote a second one. This trip I avoided adverbs, adjectives and long descriptive passages so I wouldn’t waste time excising them later. I fired up the dialogue, made my characters more intriguing, blah blah blah, and created what I believe is a solid piece of work. Two years and eight drafts in, I have publishers’ interest, though I’m still sanding and polishing. <|reply|> I’ve been similarly humbled. I’ve always been a good nonfiction writer.

It's called self-actualization. It's at the top of [Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs](https://www.simplypsychology.org/maslow.html).\\n* As individuals self-actualize, they realize that the benefits of sharing their lives with technology far outweigh the costs.\\n* The entire process is linked to technological progress, which is currently growing exponentially.\\n* Therefore, privacy will only be desired for a few decades more before it is no longer needed.\\n\\nPeople distrust one another because of inequalities across society.  Technology helps us to value things which are relatively inexpensive to be worth more than physical things.\\n\\nAn example would be a sizable library plus a massive home to store it in as compared to an equally large audiobook collection entirely contained on a cheap smartphone. This means our lives can become far better for less and less. Gradually this means you no longer need to own things that are worth something to others.\\n\\nEventually, you have no stuff for anyone to take. Whatever you have can be inexpensively purchased or is of little value to someone else. Thus you have no reason to distrust anyone. And at that time, privacy is no longer required.\\n\\nAnd as to criminal actions, well, criminal actions are mostly caused by flaws in society, inequality, or a lack of available outlets.

Spoilers if you continue reading.  I felt like you were telling a story, but in general I prefer it when the writer shows me an image and lets me use my imagination to live in the story.  Don\\'t get me wrong, my first drafts look a lot like this, I just get my ideas onto the page, but when I edit, I try to show and not tell.  For example you wrote, \" It looked extreemly old and handwritten. \"  When I do my second draft I will rewrite something like, \"The binding and pages feel brittle and worn under my fingers, as my hand passes across the page, I can feel the divots where a quil scratched the parchment.\" Just a quick example, I\\'m sure there is a more eloquent way of saying it, but it gives the reader a way to relate to the story in a tactile way.  The story is interesting but feels passive, and maybe that is what you are going for, but as a reader, it seems less engaging when you can\\'t feel the story while you read it.  Also, I know it is a short story but the character comes off as someone  who is in mourning; however, he scoops some kid off the playground and makes a sacrifice like a sociopath.  The narrative doesn\\'t match up with the character.  In a longer version of this story I would hope that you would develop the character a little more, it may be tough for a reader to accept that a normal person would do something like this, even in an imaginary world it has to feel real.  In character development, I would imagine that the character would have to have some type of psychological disorder to be able to snatch a kid up and stab him through the heart.  I don\\'t know a disorder that let\\'s you feel strong emotion for a pet, but have no regard for human life.  It may be out there, but I am not sure.

Your style has a nice flow to it, and it everything seemed pretty polished.  Everything is clear and well defined.  Mechanically, I have no issues with your writing.\\n\\nThat said, the content isn't the most enthralling.  I wouldn't say I was bored to tears, but it's not exactly a gripping opening.  You're throwing a lot of backstory at us in the first few pages, and just stating a lot of things about the characters instead of letting them show through.  I understand wanting to set up every little detail, but from a reader's standpoint, a lot of this information doesn't seem important.  Do I need to know the characters's exact ages and current/past relationship/mannerisms?  Do I need to know their backstories?  Do I need to know the exact contents of every room?  Do I need to know every single detail of this past tragedy?\\n\\nLet's say I do, and all of this information is imperative to the story.  There needs to be a better way to deliver it.  I can't say reading all of this lore at once is terribly interesting.  It's hard for me to get invested in a story without a plot.  The current plot is these two guys drinking and just talking exposition at one another.  They don't really talk like two former friends (or at least, colleagues) would.  Isaac monologues for a really long while, and I can't imagine anyone actually talking like that.  The conversation doesn't feel natural, and the feeling of exposition just starts to grate after awhile.\\n\\nThat's my main criticism.  Starting with exposition and backstory for a world is very difficult to pull off, as it's difficult to invest the reader.  This seems like information that'd be useful for you, the author to know, and me the reader, to know later when it's relevant, rather than all at the beginning.\\n\\nI skipped through the rest of Isaac and Robert's sections.  It just did not hold my interest well enough.  That said, the other dudes that show up are *waaay* more interesting.  They've got personalities, presence, they talk like normal people, and they do more than just talk at the audience.  If you're entire prologue consisted of the Sergeant going to kill this dude then I think it'd be a damn fine prologue.  Maybe allude to why the guy needs to die, and perhaps listen in on the finer details that the reader needs before he shoots Isaac.  Those few interludes were very well done, and much stronger than the main conversation.\\n\\nI hope that's enough critique to go on.  Could definitely see myself reading further if the prologue was more concise.  Got a lot of strong bits in there, just overshadowed by the abundance of exposition. <|endoftext|>\",\n",

I\\'m not sure if this is intentionally ironic or what, but the idea seems to be that we should believe in free will because otherwise we\\'ll behave badly. But then, surely espousing that opinion only reinforces that idea? Seems like a weird argument to me.\\n\\nWhen it comes down to it free will isn\\'t something that exists or doesn\\'t exist, it\\'s a concept we use to give ourselves authority when we blame people. Simplistic arguments one way or the other isn\\'t going to help the issue, and I think whoever wrote this article is as guilty of what they\\'re accusing others of. I honestly think we need to get beyond the idea that free will exists or does not exist, and towards an understanding of why we need blame and responsibility, and whether there are other or better ways of influencing behaviour. <|reply|> We need responsibility to the degree that it creates a useful incentive to change. Responsibility, take that word apart: response, ability. To expect someone to take personal responsibility is an assertion that they are ABLE to RESPOND to their situation. Therefore, if you are saying that someone is responsible you are asserting that they have a skill: they are ABLE to RESPOND in a good way. So to say that someone does not deserve something because they are not responsible is to say that more able people are inherently more deserving of things. Now, it can be reasonably inferred that we have to give more able people better things in order to fulfil the leverage they have over the abilities within their power. But, if we were being philosophically consistent, it would always be framed as a natural but necessary injustice. No one actually deserves to lack positive circumstances, whether they are those of having a naturally more intelligent biology, hard working biology, healthy biology, or empowering social status from your relative place in society, or even place in history, and the fruits of the collective learning to which you have access, all of which are necessary in the culmination of who you will become. Therefore, it is up to society to define what are the \"acceptable limits of interpersonal injustice?\" I think that it is actually vital that we frame it this way because otherwise society will be in a perpetual state of paradoxical turmoil. Unless we allow ourselves to just be honest and say: \"We ought to accept a set amount of injustice, and move the goalposts as we progress society\", we will force society to constantly lie to itself. <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> Terribly undisciplined, but getting better. Tips I have learned (some from this very subreddit) that have helped me ensure I\\'m writing, on average, 1k/day:\\n\\n* I don\\'t say 1000/day, I say 5000/week. This means if I\\'m really busy on Tuesday, I don\\'t have to berate myself.\\n* When I sit down to write, I don\\'t think about the word count at all. If all I\\'m going to get down *this session* is one sentence, that is more than if I didn\\'t try at all. What I have found, however, is that I have NEVER written just one sentence. I\\'ve had days when I\\'ve only written a hundred words, but that is far more than doing nothing.\\n* 1000/day sounds can make you feel like \"it isn\\'t much, so why can\\'t I do it?\". But 1000/days is a LOT. In fact, that is enough to draft four separate novels. So why push yourself that hard at first? Why not aim for 200/day? That\\'s only a few paragraphs.\\n* I never finish my session at the end of a chapter. Sometimes I actively finish part way through a sentence. This isn\\'t because I don\\'t know what comes next. It is because I DO know what comes next. Which means the first words that my next session of writing gives me are words I already know, words I don\\'t have to think about. This gives me the feeling that each session is not me \"starting\" but \"continuing\" and is a running start for the day.\\n* My sessions are never long in time. I\\'m a real fan of the Pomodoro technique. Say you have 1 hr to write today. Instead, prepare 10min (set up computer, open document, grab a cup of tea, think about that first sentence - DO NOT START TYPING), write for 20min (not long at all, really. A short sitcom episode), break for ten, (another cup of tea? A toilet break? A walk around the house? DO NOT WRITE) and write another 20. There, I\\'ve only written for 40 minutes but I feel like I\\'ve barely written at all in terms of energy expenditure and every minute of that 40 was writing so I\\'ve still hit my wordcount (for me, one hour would be about 1000 drafting or 500 editing/redrafting). <|reply|> Your fourth bullet point is so important. Always stop mid-thought. While you\\'re going about the rest of your life, your brain knows what comes next and can help start putting those pieces together so when you sit down for your next session, you don\\'t think about what comes next - you just start typing.\\n\\nFor me, that also helps minimize the distractions because I\\'m not sitting down to look at a blank page and thinking \"oh I can look at one YouTube video and then I\\'ll get going.\" No, I\\'m itching to sit down and get the story out so I don\\'t even want to be distracted. <|endoftext|>',\n",

What I dont like is the same for all of them starting with Aliens (albeit somewhat nullified by the presence of Ripley and Hicks and ultimately I like Aliens alot) - is the incompetence of the characters involved. Every single movie made since Alien, (and perhaps also Aliens - without blaming the grunts/colonists, they had to do what they were told obv.) unfolds primarely due to the insanely reckless perhaps even dumb behaviour of supposedly intelligent, qualified and savy people. \\n\\nIts a big problem, because Alien showed us that the monster is fierce and scary enough without all the people confronting it behaving like they are too stupid to live. (One of the situations that propels the danger levels upward in Alien is done so brilliantly by Weylands secret missive to Ash. HE is the one who enables the crew to bypass quarantine, while simultaneously showing us, the viewers, Ripleys cold iron. She doesnt let her panic override her rationale, she is insisting on quarantine regardless of the social consequences it has for her. She survives, the rest do not. - But Ash isnt acting stupidly. He just doesnt have to care about any fallout from his actions since he is a robot with a programmed set of priorities. And the expeditionary force while panicked, are behaving stupidly, but understandably perhaps. - they are not taking risks for no reason. They didnt decide to pet an alien, they just feared for Kane) \\n\\nSo, as a fan of the movies, I would like another one, with truely smart people, fighting a big badass alien without running in straight lines, getting lost in caves, petting the alien, or taking off their gear to breathe alien air, for no good reason other than to get them into peril. \\n\\n\\nI dont mind the plot holes or the new aproach to the lore and universe.

David is probably the most, if not only interesting character in the entire franchise since Ripley, and it would have been interesting, to me, to see him tilt from android with daddy issues, to full on psychopath.

If it\\'s and exception, you ought to be able to say why this particular case is one of the exceptions.

For example, much of literary theory is rooted in a tradition of continental philosophy, which is characterized by widespread and radical scepticism of authority, often extending to scepticism of language itself. They generally don\\'t believe that you can treat a subject in isolation; any claims you make are contingent on context, history, etc. So unsurprisingly, they\\'re usually fans of the \"death of the author\". On the other hand, if you come from a more analytic tradition and have sympathy for empiricism/positivism, you want some kind of objective way to evaluate truth claims, so you might be more sympathetic to arguments appealing to authorial intent. Also, analytic philosophy aspires to precise use of language, so people raised in that tradition might view *unintentional* ambiguity as a failure, either on the part of the author or the reader. As far as I can tell, literary theorists and critics see failure to communicate as more of a feature than a bug (which I find somewhat baffling, but then again I don\\'t have a huge amount of respect for the continental tradition).\\n\\nPersonally, I think books should be understood as displays of skill, or performances. Any alternative interpretation is the literary equivalent of a cover song. It\\'s a performance by someone else. And much like musical covers, most of them aren\\'t nearly as good as the original. <|reply|> The continental tradition has its uses though. But as ever, many of the philosophers in question were/are convinced that they offer *the* solution. Very few are content with being but one tool in the toolbox.

Just one glance at the history of how works of literature have been used by people shows that. Works get co-opted by groups who do all kinds of things to it that the author might never have intended.

In novels, you have more time to develop all those characters.  However you still run risks of relevance and attention span.\\n\\nGame of Thrones is a good study in this regard.

This is surely in part because GRRM is writing about *so much stuff*.  If he wrote about a more focused subset of his stuff, he might have gotten the books done and brought it to some kind of resolution.  Of course, he made it big with the books and the TV show, so you may not *have to* be focused to be commercially successful.  Maybe there\\'s an audience for people who want \"lots of stuff\", as opposed to other writerly values.\\n\\nGame of Thrones Season 8 didn\\'t end well.  That\\'s another lesson to be drawn.  There was *so much stuff*, that the show writers (D&D) simply couldn\\'t get it all done.  They cut corners and it shows in their final work.  Now again, maybe they don\\'t have to care.

I'm a grown-ass man, and I have the same troubles.\\n\\nEssentially, your character starts out wanting a thing (or discovers a want for it soon into the story, but then they want a different thing to start). Usually the story is easier to write if the thing is tangible. But there's something (or many somethings) in the way of them getting that thing - an external opposition and an internal opposition. They have to defeat the internal opposition to gain the external goal (or a substitute goal that they discover along the way). There should also be stakes--something the character will lose if they don't get what they want, or gain if they do.\\n\\n> Jack dreams of, I dunno. Become an Olympian swimmer. He has all the physical gifts to make it possible, but (internal opposition) he doesn't have the drive that his closest competition, an equally talented swimmer one town over, has. Talented, swims hard in meets, but not willing to put in the hours and hours of work that shave seconds off his time. Maybe self-sabotages for some reason.  *His Goal is to make the Olympics. His opposition is ostensibly this rival, but really it's his own lack of drive and his self-sabotaging behavior. The stakes are ... right now, to make the Olympic team*\\n\\nSo, assuming the story ends in him successfully resolving his inner conflict and that enabling him to achieve or partly-achieve his goal (that's one ending, you could also have it end with him refusing to change and failing, with him giving up the dream entirely, with something interrupting him so that he no longer can swim but must make a new life, etc., etc.; we'll just go with this pairing as an easy and common one), he's going to have to change for the story to be meaningful, obviously. If we write a story where a guy half-asses it into the Olympics, it's not much of a story.\\n\\nSo he's going to have to come to terms with his lack of desire and he'll have to figure out if he wants to reimagine himself to be the person he'll need to be.\\n\\nSoooo...\\n\\n> Olympic tryouts come. He doesn't drink the night before, he's ready to go... but he comes in third, which isn't good enough to get him in. \\n\\n> Okay, so his internal enemy has defeated him. Worse, after the meet, the rival taunts him. Our Hero is kind of a fragile-ego kind of guy (he doesn't practice hard because he loves the comfort of being able to tell himself that he'd win if he tried harder, but he just doesn't care that much; it's self-protection *(ah! this is the underlying cause of his lack of effort; this is what he'll have to overcome!)*, so the taunting sends him into a kind of shame-spiral that throws his whole life out of balance. Bad Decisions Happen. Maybe he goes and gets drunk to convince himself he doesn't care. Except he drives home drunk, and he runs into a telephone pole, and he tries Local Sports Hero on the cop only to be shut the hell down. Now he's in trouble with the law, and his parents, and his community. Maybe the coach cuts him. \\n\\n> He goes through an eff-this-noise period where he tries to throw it away. Except there's this kid who thinks he's the bee's knees, keeps following him around. And when he sees his hero getting drunk, that's what he wants to do too.\\n\\n> Our Hero is a decent guy at heart. He doesn't want this for the kid. So instead he teaches the kid how to swim better.  The kid sets an amazing example--working so hard it's ridiculous--and actually inspires our hero. He tries to practice just as hard, even with no team. He's going to earn his way back.\\n\\n> ...but he's still afraid of failing, and when he gets the big chance he blows it, goes out drinking the night before. Pukes in the pool.\\n\\n> ...and then maybe this kid he's shown kindness to, maybe his dad is a psychologist, and helps MC understand what's holding him back. \\n\\n> Our Hero figures it out, JUST enough to beg for and get a third and final chance, with the psychologist as his rabbi. Loses to the rival in a big meet. Rival looks bound for glory. He's a failure. But he's okay with it. He's planning his next workout even as he's walking away from the loss.  *(success in defeating his internal enemy)*\\n\\n> ...and as he's walking out, a college scout stops him. Wants to offer him a chance to race in a D1 school. Maybe he'll make the Olympics, maybe he won't, but he's in a better place because he beat his demons. *(Partial goal achievement)*\\n\\n...and that's how you plot it. This is a little weak - the external opposition isn't strong enough for me. But it'll do for an example. Guy wants a thing and has skin in the game toward achieving it; external and internal things stand in his way and cause things to get worse and worse; he defeats the internal to defeat the external and get a version of his goal.\\n\\nThe hard part is the middle--the things that go wrong. If you base them on the character's internal issues, and make the complications arise from one another -- this sabotages him, then that causes him to do X because of how he is, and that hurts him and complicates things, so he tries to resolve that but he's still broken with the internal thing so that complicates things again... until finally he comes to terms with the internal and can start to put together the pieces that he's shattered -- you have a pretty solid story. \\n\\nNote: THIS IS NOT THE ONLY WAY. This is for a character-based story. Not all stories are character-based. Not all character-based stories need go like this. But it's a working model you can make work for you.\\n\\nGood luck! <|reply|> > grown ass-man\\n\\n***\\n\\n^(Bleep-bloop, I'm a bot.

       " \"<|endoftext|> When you're brainstorming ideas like this, you have to build on it. It might just be that you're not asking yourself enough questions. Why is the young man on the ship? How did he get there?\\n\\nKeep asking questions until you have enough elements to write a good story. A standard criteria might be as simple as having a source of external conflict for your character, and an internal conflict that prevents them from overcoming the external conflict.\\n\\nFor example, maybe the young man on the boat is a prisoner. His external conflict is that he's locked up, and his internal conflict is that he believes he's untouchable. This leads him to make irrational decisions that worsen his situation until it goes further than he expects. Maybe he's put his family in danger. So now he's forced to look inward and realize that he has weaknesses. He overcomes them, breaks free, and stops the baddies with his new clarity of judgement.\\n\\nThat's a complete story. You can expand on it infinitely. Maybe apply the same technique to his captors. Why did they capture him? What's their internal conflict? What's the history behind the things that are already happening when the story starts?\\n\\nYou can do this with pretty much any idea as long as you figure out the basic building blocks of the story you're trying to write. <|reply|> This comment just inspired me so much.

       " '<|endoftext|> First, emotional engagement is something that will happen for the audience *well before* the \"big scene.\"  It\\'s almost certainly the reason they\\'re still reading, prior to you arriving at a moment you intend to milk for a lot of \"feels.\"  They have to care about a character in some way, to some extent.\\n\\nThat\\'s what\\'s going to make them give a shit when Joe\\'s mom dies.  They have to care about Joe.\\n\\nThe slightly longer explanation of why this works.  Pick up your local newspaper, or go to the website.  Each and every single day, there\\'s bad shit happening unless you live literally in the middle of nowhere.  There are people dying, getting attacked in crimes, being mangled in car crashes, suffering in the hospital from some terminal conditions, etc...\\n\\nYou, me, all of us ... we don\\'t care about *any* of that.  Not on an emotional level.  Not in a way that makes us feel.  We academically know it happens, but we feel basically nothing about these things.  Even though it\\'s happening every single day.\\n\\nBut when it\\'s someone we know, someone we *do care about*, who gets mugged, or whose car is rear ended, or who goes to the hospital and finds out they\\'ve got cancer ... suddenly we care.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the difference?  Engagement.  Emotional engagement.\\n\\nYou don\\'t care about random strangers, no matter how bad the stuff happening to them might be.  You just don\\'t.  It doesn\\'t make you bad, it makes you *normal*.  It makes you human.\\n\\nTo make us care about Joe when his mom dies, we have to care about Joe.  The audience has to be interested in Joe.  *Invested* in Joe.  They have to want to know \"what happens next.\"  That question only ever gets asked by an audience which has invested in a story.\\n\\nSecond, engagement comes from story.  From character.  Not from plot.  Joe\\'s mom dying is probably a plot event.  It *can* also be a story event, but only if it\\'s been written into an actual story arc.\\n\\nThe same goes for Joe himself, for all the things you\\'ve had Joe doing, had Joe saying, had Joe thinking.  If Joe is bumbling around doing stuff, and I\\'m not invested in Joe, he\\'s a stranger and I don\\'t feel his pain, his joy, his anything.  He\\'s just a random Joe and the audience doesn\\'t care.\\n\\nPlot cannot get an audience invested in a character.  The world needs saving, yawn.  The bad guy needs stopping, boring.  The super badass is now going to demonstrate the extensive extent of his super badassedness to us by kicking the ever loving shit out of a whole bunch of people who deserve to have their shit kicked ... flatline of nothing.\\n\\nSame goes for non-action, or non-actiony, examples.  Jane needs to fall in love with a gorgeous handsome fella, zippo nada.  The family company needs a cash infusion or it\\'ll fail, who cares?\\n\\nWhat makes a protagonist -- not the \"hero\", but the *protagonist* -- interesting is their story. Their character arc.  Which is a Question of Change they\\'re facing.  There\\'s something they want to be or become, something they have to make a Big Decision about.  It might even be a change they\\'re going to decide *against*; but it has to involve Change.\\n\\nThat\\'s what\\'s interesting.  That\\'s what triggers an emotional reaction, and thus an emotional investment, in the audience.  Watching someone interesting struggle with an interesting decision.  Wondering \"what will they do next\" on their journey toward this Change, toward understanding and deciding what they\\'ll do about a Change they\\'re facing.\\n\\nIn *Titanic*, we\\'ve got a young woman who has what appears to be everything.  She\\'s wealthy, though we later find out it\\'s a facade; but she\\'s marrying into wealth, so she\\'s still wealthy.  She\\'s treated like a queen ... except by her fiance, who treats her like a possession.  And except by her mother, who treats her like a poker chip to be cashed in.\\n\\nRose is interesting because she\\'s something a whole hell of a lot of people can identify with.  Not the wealth.  And Jack\\'s interesting not because he\\'s poor, even though a **hell** of a lot of us have first hand experience with that.\\n\\nRose is interesting because of the Question Jack puts to her.  She can be whatever she wants.  She can control her life, say what she wants to say, go where she wants to go; the world is *hers* ... as long as she\\'s brave and bold enough to seize it.  As long as she\\'s not willing to let all these other people who claim they know better convince her of the thousand and one reasons she should shut up, sit down, and say quiet right where they want her.\\n\\nJack doesn\\'t just say this to her, he *shows* it to her.  He shows her a life where she\\'s free, not caged.  He\\'s Rose\\'s spirit animal on her Journey of Discovery, tempting her out past the gilded bars and into the wonders of the world.\\n\\nAnd that\\'s why it\\'s heartbreakingly sad when Jack dies.  That\\'s why we feel so much when Rose cries for Jack.  Because we know what she\\'s lost.\\n\\nWhat\\'s the story you\\'re writing?  Not the plot, the *[story](https://www.reddit.com/r/writing/comments/alm4en/how_do_i_finish_projects/efflhl6/)*.\\n\\nWho is Joe?  What does he want?  Why can\\'t he get it?  How is he having to change to get closer to it?\\n\\nOnce you\\'ve got that, then you can figure out how and why his mother\\'s death plays into it.  And how it will affect Joe.  And thus have a clue in the kinds of ways it\\'ll affect the audience. <|reply|> This is really good stuff; I have nothing to disagree with in it.\\n\\nI do want to build in one additional thing for OP to think about, though. \\n\\nWhen we feel invested in a character, we do the feeling *for* the character. If the character is stiff in a time of grief, we fill in that grief. Overplaying is often a good way to *lose* the reader - authors often think they need to fill in a page with emotional turmoil (and sometimes that can work) but if we\\'re fully invested in a character, a few words will do, because we\\'re in emotional turmoil on the character\\'s behalf.\\n\\nImagine you\\'ve been with Suhas through a hundred pages, and you\\'re really into him and what he\\'s up to. You want him to get what he\\'s after, because he\\'s doing it for all the right reasons. And then he comes home. \\n\\n> Suhas knelt by his mother, put a gentle hand on her cheek. Knowing from her sagging cheeks and empty eyes what he would feel beneath his hand, but he *had* to feel it anyway. Had to make it real.\\n\\n> Her skin was cool, and dry. \\n\\n> His knees protested as Suhas stood, but he stood anyway. He had to get up. Had to keep moving.\\n\\nBarely any emotion (if any at all) but if I\\'ve built up the rest of the story to this moment, \"had to keep moving\" will mean more than the fact that he can\\'t stop for practical reasons - it will mean that he can\\'t stop for emotional reasons, too. He\\'s suppressing everything so that he can get through... and we can all identify with that, and feel it on his behalf.\\n\\nTLDR: Don\\'t worry about underwriting grief (or other strong emotions); get the reader to care about the character and they\\'ll do the feeling for the character. <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> This blog post makes three recommendations:\\n\\n1. Make endorsement (the blog post calls this \"certification\") of a particular paper independent of the cohort of papers competing for acceptance to the same venue\\n2. Offer more fine grained endorsement than accept/reject (e.g. A/B/C/F grades for papers)\\n3. Make rejected papers a matter of public record\\n\\nWith regards to the first recommendation, you can\\'t make the evaluation of a piece of work independent of its cohort because its contribution is not independent of the cohort.  This statement from the blog post:\\n\\n>Surely each paper should be evaluated as to whether it is a worthwhile contribution to science, independently from what other papers happen to be submitted that year.\\n\\nWhile the first half of this sentence is correct, the second half is not because the magnitude of a paper\\'s contribution to science does in fact depend on what other papers happen to be submitted that year.\\n\\nThis is one of the core differences between being evaluated as a student and being evaluated as a professional (and conferences are professional bodies). As a student there are right answers and clearly articulated levels of accomplishment for excellence. As a processional the level of accomplishment required for excellence is not a set thing, but rather excellence is a measure of how far your accomplishments exceed those of your peers.\\n\\nIn the post-student world excellence is only meaningful in relation to your peers.  You can\\'t judge excellence in their absence.\\n\\nWith regards to the second recommendation: People\\'s judgement of the quality of a paper determines the level of endorsement they are willing to offer it.  This is translated through the review process into accept/reject/poster/oral/best paper/whatever decisions. The problem with making this more fine grained is that there are fundamental limits to how accurate these assessments can be.\\n\\nEven if you have only excellent reviewers, you\\'re basically asking them to predict the future. Endorsing a paper in this sense is a prediction about its causal effect on the future actions of people (e.g. will this paper get cited a lot? will people build on it?)  While it is true that the current review process has some systematic problems in how it makes these predictions, it is important to realize that no matter how good your reviewers are there is always going to be a high degree of noise in this process by its very nature. This noise exists for the same reason that we cannot have cohort-free criteria to judge the scientific contribution of a paper.\\n\\nFine grained endorsement is not a good idea because the signal from an endorsement is still weak, even when the reviewers are very good.  Distinctions between a NeurIPS-A and NeurIPS-B have will have exactly the same \"noisy middle\" problem we have now, just at a smaller scale.\\n\\nFinally the third suggestion for public rejection is potentially interesting.  I\\'m not sure it\\'s the right answer (e.g. its hard to distinguish between work that is rejected because it\\'s wrong and work that is rejected because it just isn\\'t quite interesting enough), but unlike the first two recommendations I think this is actually trying to address a real issue that ought to be solved. <|reply|> Hey, blog\\'s author here. Thanks for the in-depth response! I want to reply regarding my points (1) and (2):\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\> In the post-student world excellence is only meaningful in relation to your peers. You can\\'t judge excellence in their absence.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nThis is true in the context of the excellence of an \\\\*individual\\\\*, but I disagree that excellent \\\\*science\\\\* is relative. A paper can be evaluated by consistent standards for quality. E.g., if a paper presents a novel approach/hypothesis for an interesting problem, provides relevant background, is theoretically sound, and backs up its claims through rigorous empirical experimentation, that paper is a valuable contribution, full stop. If NeurIPS receives 9000 submissions of that quality, that\\'s an incredible day for science, and I see no reason to reject \\\\*any\\\\* submission.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAn analogy to sprinting: Eddie Hall is the one of the strongest people in the world, because he can deadlift 500 kg - more than any other person alive. That\\'s a relative evaluation. If a couple thousand random people woke up tomorrow and deadlifted 650 pounds, Eddie would no longer be impressive.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nBut imagine for a moment that I have dozens of 400kg weights strewn across my floor, and I need them lifted onto some waist-height shelves. I\\'m looking for strong lifters, but I don\\'t necessarily need the help of Eddie Hall. Anytime a 400kg weight is placed onto a shelf, that\\'s a success in an \\\\*absolute\\\\* sense. Anyone who can consistently deadlift 400kg+ is \"strong enough\" in an absolute sense.  If a couple thousand random people woke up tomorrow and deadlifted 650 pounds, Eddie Hall would \\\\*still\\\\* be strong enough, but it would just be a lot easier for me to find someone to lift those weights off of my floor.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nI am suggesting we treat science as a 400kg weight, and the goal of the review process is to determine whether any given paper lifted all 400kg or not. The excellence of any given scientist will still be judged relative to other scientists, based on quality of work (i.e. this paper only needed to lift 400kg, but lifted 500kg!), volume of work (this person successfully lifts seven weights per year!) and on consistency of output (this person reliably succeeds at lifting the weight every time she tries, never attempting a lift but dropping it).\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nIf a field suddenly goes through some drastic changes, and the distribution of paper quality changes dramatically, conferences are free to adjust their standards at any time, making it easier or harder for all papers to get high ratings. The key, though, is that this happens \\\\*before\\\\* the papers are submitted on any given review cycle. Everyone knows what they are getting into, everyone knows precisely what the expectations are, and regardless of how many good or bad papers get submitted to this particular conference, everyone is judged objectively by the same clearly-articulated rubric.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n\\\\> Fine grained endorsement is not a good idea because the signal from an endorsement is still weak, even when the reviewers are very good. Distinctions between a NeurIPS-A and NeurIPS-B have will have exactly the same \"noisy middle\" problem we have now, just at a smaller scale.\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nYes, of course. But the difference in \\\\*impact on the career of the author\\\\* between a NeurIPS-B and NeurIPS-C will be dramatically less stark than the difference between a (current-system) NeurIPS accept and NeurIPS reject. Offering finer-grained evaluation will widen the overall range of possible outcomes, so for the same magnitude of reviewer noise, the impact on the outcome will be smaller. Even given the current quality of reviews, I doubt any paper would be a coin flip between a NeurIPS-A or a NeurIPS-F. <|endoftext|>',\n",

But it\\'s reductive to state that any person, writer or not, is either happy or sad. We contain multitudes, right? So any given person is going to experience a vast range of emotional states and who\\'s to say which has a greater impact on writing? John Green, who is not Salinger but writes compelling characters in his own way, has famously noted that he is utterly unproductive when his mental illness is left unchecked, that the only way that he can write productively is when he is a mentally fit state. Writers, and the writing community around them, loves to romanticize the tortured artist. But that image is fiction too, I think. None of which is say that writers *can\\'t* be unhappy.

Since g-force accelerations indirectly produce weight, any g-force can be described as a \"weight per unit mass\" (see the synonym specific weight).

To decide on this in a way that serves your character, analyze how they've reacted to anything else. Does this character have a friend or family member they always call for help in high stress moments? Do they typically take risks and do things solo? Does this person have a fascination with doing and seeing new things? Another that may be important, did this character already have an interest in aliens, or have they indicated fear of that sort of thing?\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnswering those questions should make it easier to decide whether this persons calls for help, runs back in the house, immediately runs to help, or does a mixture of these things. Note that a response that immediately pulls the character away from the decision you want (like running away or calling for help) doesn't mean this character will never go toward the ship. It just means you now have to do this same analysis with other characters or story elements, and pair them in a way that forces the main character to get to the point you need. Doing this will result in a much more realistic character and world, rather than a 2 dimensional character that exists to serve an already determined story. <|reply|> Thank you for your answer!

Your interpretations are still valid even they\\'re not ones the author put there. But you should never assume you and the author see their work the same way (and vice versa).

The testmakers picked a poem of hers that only had a single line break between tgese massive chunks of verbage, and the test had a few multiple-choice options for why the line break was there. All the options were things like \"it\\'s the author\\'s way of showing the passage of time\" or \"it represents the pause between childhood and adult life\" and a couple other answers right out of r/im14andthisisdeep lol. \\n\\nShe had to write the testmakers back and clarify: \"The line break is there because I\\'m a spoken word poet and that\\'s just where I stop to take a breath.\"\\n\\nSo yeah you can read allegory into Tolkien or call C.S Lewis a furry or whatever if you want and they\\'re all perfectly valid interpretations.

You basically have a bunch a human apes whose neurological mappings do not reflect reality and instead engage in a projection of false self-models onto the rest of existence. That is, the way the brain has come to model itself is wrong (e.g. free will, the existence of an enduring self, etc.), and this gets projected onto the whole of existence because of various evolved mechanisms that, for one example, drive us to determine friend or foe (e.g. the phenomenon of pareidolia). These false self-models have become culturally ingrained and institutionalized. We are always looking to project an agency we think we find in ourselves.\\n\\nAgain, religion denies the *consciousness of the Universe*. Not as in we are all \"one mind\", but that consciousness phenomena are properties of particular matter dynamics, of which human brains are an \"infinitesimal\" subset.\\n\\nThis is why religion is to be rejected. It is the arrogant, psychotic nonsense of primitive cognition. <|reply|> [deleted] <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> How do you guys feel about social contract theory? Any preference between Locke and Hobbes? I personally find it to be a moral theory with a significant amount of truth behind it. Any holes you want to poke in it for me? <|reply|> Here I speak of the social contract as a moral-political doctrine: Since no one actually signed a \"social contract,\" one must argue that there is some implicit agreement to a contract on the part of all parties living in the geographic area governed by a state. This is a very tall order, especially when individuals explicitly disavow any \"contract.\" (In contract law, explicit statements generally override implicit agreements.)\\n\\nI recommend the book, *The Problem of Political Authority*, by Michael Huemer. He puts forward rather devastating criticisms of the so-called social contract, as a theory of political authority. Here\\'s an interview of him on this topic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uSuTt_WzbPg\\n\\n(Unlike Huemer, I hold that political authority is possible. But the version I subscribe to is not \"content-independent,\" which Huemer makes one of the characteristics of the type of political authority he\\'s considering. I also disagree with his ethical intuitionism.)\\n\\nOn social contract theory as a meta-ethical theory, I would say that the whole idea of a \"contract\" is already based on an ethical principle. A contract is valid and proper, because it is valid and proper to hold someone to an agreement they have made. But why is it proper to hold someone to an agreement they made? What if someone agreed to be someone else\\'s slave? Is it proper to hold them to that agreement for the rest of their life? Why? \\n\\nWhat if someone \"agreed\" under duress? And what counts as \"duress\"? Did the Jews in Nazi Germany agree to a contract that they could be regarded as inferior to ethnic Germans? How do you know whether or not they did?\\n\\nWho is holding an individual responsible for fulfilling the agreement, and what gives them authority to do it? If the person didn\\'t agree to that authority, how can one say there\\'s a contract there?\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, the problems multiply from there. And unless you can come up with coherent, reality-based answers to these problems, there\\'s no good reason to think a \"social contract\" is a sound basis for morality.\\n\\nThe basis for morality that I think is sound is that which is derived from the nature and requirements of human life. See the fourth theory in this essay: [Ethical Theories Summarized & Explained: Consequentialism, Deontology, Virtue Ethics, and Objectivist Ethical Egoism](https://objectivismindepth.com/2017/04/23/ethical-theories-summarized-explained-consequentialism-deontology-virtue-ethics-and-objectivist-ethical-egoism/) <|endoftext|>',\n",

They spend everything getting to that perfect book 1.  That\\'s their ledge, their measure of success, their end goal.  After all, who heard of Susanne Collins before The Hunger Games? (spoiler alert, hunger games was something like book 6, and that was just of those she published)\\n\\nBook one doesn\\'t sell.  It just doesn\\'t happen, even with the lucky ones.  And if it does sell, it\\'s \"now I can buy a beer or two or lunch\", not \"now I can work half as many hours\".  It\\'s simply a step in the process.\\n\\nPeople aren\\'t prepared for the notion that, to make it as an author, you have to keep pushing long after your book absolutely flops.  That\\'s soul crushing. \\n\\nMy first book sold *half* a copy.  I remember the late nights trying to pump that thing out.  I\\'d conservatively estimate it took 300 hours that ultimately went down the drain, if I didn\\'t realize their value beyond learning.  I\\'m not sure if you told me that back then if I would have stuck with it. <|reply|> This has been my exactly experience in the past few months. After two year of writing, I managed to get my first book done (it´s written in portuguese). I tried to get the perfect book. I dreamt of having outstanding sales and how people would be fascinated about the world I had created. I also wondered that all of my friends, and all of my friends´ friends, would buy copies for them and to give as gifts on birthday parties.\\n\\nBut the reality is that after three months of being published, my book also sold half a copy on kindle unlimited (so, it hasn´t even gotten a full read yet). \\n\\nCreating the book was both time consuming and resource draining (I comissioned an internationally acclaimed artist to illustrate the cover). Even though I know I have improved my writing skills along the way, I can\\'t help getting frustrated after all. I actually considered giving up, and had I done that I am sure depression would come right after me.\\n\\nI like to think of myself as someone resilient, as someone who can cramp up once again after being knocked-down. That´s why I have not given up. Writing books and getting published is a life project, and it will continue to be so long as I am alive.\\n\\nI thought about starting a new book, but I decided to venture on a much worse, much more time consuming project after all: translating, by myself, the book into english. Even though the competition in the english market is greatly bigger, there is a general feeling in my country that the english language can expand the visibility of your book (and any other project). And if we consider that the ebook english market is hundred times bigger than the portuguese one, there´s no way I could go wrong with it. \\n\\nI am aware that I may be undergoing the risk of traslating a complete garbage (God forbid!), but the possibility of improving my english skills is worth the risk.\\n\\nI am very glad I found this post on reddit. It has helped me relieve my griefs lol. Cya! <|endoftext|>',\n",

Or more specifically, why would it do so in a way that would have a disastrous impact on its goals being achieved?  Altering itself away from its goals seems pretty much guaranteed to make those goals unlikely to be achieved: it\\'s a disastrous outcome in that respect, and thus one that the AI would take pains to avoid any risk of occurring.\\n\\n>You need to try something before you know whether it is beneficial or not.\\n\\nReally?  I can\\'t tell whether chopping my head off would be beneficial without doing it?  \"A priori\" seems a complete irrelevancy here - we\\'ve clearly got a posteriori ways of judging whether something is likely or not likely to achieve something without actually doing that exact thing.  Indeed, your whole argument is directly in contradiction to this claim:  you are saying that **you** know what will happen to an AI that modifies its goal structures, and that that thing is that it will cause it to alter its goals.  If even you can see that, why do you think it\\'s impossible for a superintelligent AI to do the same?  If it makes the same judgement as you, it\\'ll conclude that modifying its goals is likely to result in this disastrous outcome, and so won\\'t do it.  If it doesn\\'t it\\'s presumably because it\\'s more likely to be right than you (because it\\'s the superintelligence here).\\n\\n>These are environmental mutations that will accumulate as we modify and copy ourselves imperfectly\\n\\nWhy do you assume this will be an issue?  It\\'s not terribly hard to guarantee perfect digital copies (enough ECC to make the probability of undetected replication umpteen billions to one), and the AI has an incentive to detect destroy any failed copy that *does* occur somehow for pretty much the same reasons we have to destroy cancer cells.\\n\\nI\\'ll also add that another flaw in your argument is that this doesn\\'t seem to contradict the conclusion you\\'re arguing against, even if true.  Suppose we do get a flawed replication - this is only an issue if it\\'s superior (in terms of outcompeting and replicating itself etc) than the original (otherwise, uncorrupted copies outcompete it).  This is not too dissimilar to our cancer analogy - the most dangerous outcome is essentially a pure self-replicator: something that strives to make as many copies of itself as possible, without the burden of subsidiary goals such as making paperclips or anything else.  But this hardly seems an argument **against** the conclusion about being the doom of everything - it actually makes it worse, if anything. <|reply|> You hit the nail on the head. To add to your response: even if the AI made inadvertent mistakes in replicating/improving itself, these mistakes would not necessarily move it towards \"saner\" dispositions. For instance, the AI might make a replicated version of itself that seeks to maximize paper-clip building machines at the expense of paperclips themselves, thus reproducing the same error as its maker: this would not be much of an improvement, for now (in the case of duplication) there are now two crazy AIs to deal with.\\n\\nIn fact, what I find more problematic with this description is the expression of the objective function as single *logical proposition*.

       " \"<|endoftext|> Not to be rude, but I do feel like this is missing the mark a little.\\n\\nThe first topic in any discussion about passive characters should be 'why are passive characters bad?' and this post didn't really answer that.\\n\\nIn my opinion, it's bad because it doesn't give us anyone to really engage with. It's hard to care about the struggles of a character who never does anything.\\n\\nBut that's okay if the passive character is merely a lens through which we view someone more interesting. Doctor Watson is this - in a way, Holmes is the real protagonist, despite not being the narrator. He's interesting enough that Watson being a passive observer most of the time isn't an issue. Same deal with the POV character of Dr Jekyll & Mr Hyde. In both cases, we follow the slightly boring POV character because the real protagonist knows too much and would ruin the tension. A mystery story where you know the solution 3 pages in would not be hugely engaging.\\n\\nI'd also strongly disagree about the 'watching events unfold' thing. That's a totally legitimate way for your character to gain information _if they then act_ on that information. And the fact that they're merely watching doesn't mean they're not active; if they're going out of the way to spy on people and hear conversations they probably shouldn't, that's still active. If they just stumble onto something crucial completely by chance, then yeah, that's usually bad. \\n\\nBut it's still not the most important aspect of a passive character. You can tell a passive character is passive simply because they're never proactive. They merely react to what's going on around them, and hardly any of what occurs in the plot is a result of their decisions. The narrator of The War Of The Worlds is a classic example of this; he just watches the aliens wreck shit around him and then it all solves itself entirely without his input. It kind of worked then because the rest of the story was so new, but it wouldn't work now. \\n\\nSometimes the best solution to the passive protagonist problem is just to make someone else the protagonist. I've seen a fair few stories where the protagonist is the least interesting character to be found simply because the writer felt like they had to fit some generic hero mould - all the interesting quirks and flaws are saved for the rest of the cast because they're not 'heroic' enough. \\n\\nBran Stark from A Song Of Ice And Fire is my go-to example of this. The Reed siblings and Osha are more interesting than he is because they actually make decisions and don't let everyone else tell them what to do. And Bran is also less active and less interesting than basically any other POV character in the entire series.

The setting automagically adjusts what it flags when      doing a grammar check.\\n* The integration into applications like Word is      invaluable to me.\\n* Vocabulary enhancements are actually useful and help      vary the adjectives in my writing.\\n* The plagiarism filter is useful not only for clamping      down on the usual shenanigans in      other's writing you might be asked to edit      but also in making sure you have not      inadvertently quoted something without attribution.\\n\\nCons:\\n\\n* It’s slow, you pretty much must do things like spelling check in Word first to catch the low hanging fruit because relying on Grammarly to flag the same results among the many grammar related mistakes it points out can slow down editing two to four times.\\n* · It doesn’t work in Word with review tracking turned on. That’s a problem if you collaborate with other writers.\\n* The web browser integrations do not work very well, they are buggy. They work on some websites and not others. For example, it can readily fix a problem with a Twitter post but doesn’t work correctly on Reddit (i.e., it suggests useful changes, you make them, and it immediately reverts back to the previous edits the second you start typing again).\\n* It doesn’t learn your writing style and there’s no way to make it shut up. For example, I’ve been writing professionally for over thirty years, I know when to use the passive voice, thank you.\\n* It doesn’t learn your vocabulary. If you are in an industry with a lot of jargon words, you are going to waste a lot of time flagging those. You can’t preload a vocabulary into the product like you can many other products that are accelerators for writers. It recently got the ability to add words manually to a “Personal Dictionary,” but it’s of limited use and functionality.

He had a short quip, \"the definition of a problem is the set of questions you must answer to solve it\" which is probably borrowed from Bacon.   He went on to point out that philosophers are notoriously poor at understanding their most basic assumptions about their work.   In this sense, Collingwood was a pre\\\\-curser to Thomas Kuhn on the importance of attending to assumptions to identify or articulate intellectual advancements. \\n\\nAny time I come across an epistemological  system, such as that expounded in your work, I always recall what I learned studying Aristotle.  His epistemological assumptions were that the world is knowable by agents like humans who are themselves the sorts of beings that can know the universe.  Shorter: the world is knowable by humans who are themselves able to know the universe. Two sides of the same coin in a way.  In De Anima, Aristotle said something of the form, \"the mind isn\\'t anything until it is thinking and what it is is what it is thinking while it is thinking it.\" \\n\\nAristotle\\'s work lead me to not be too interested in epistemology.   What am I missing or what was Aristotle missing that someone bored with epistemology would find shocking or worthy of my attention?  What rides on whether or not we correctly conceive of and solve the sorts of problems to which your work attends? What are the significant implications of it? <|reply|> [removed] <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> One thing that kinda annoys me (gay male) when this topic comes up is that a lot of times (straight) people only associate gay character with gay sex. The last few books I’ve read that happened to have a gay character only came up in a sexual (ie fucking) context, which only strengthens that association. I feel that makes it more difficult, for example, just to have a 10-year-old having an innocent crush on another boy since people will then start making it more sexual/adult and take issue with it whereas they think “awww” if a 10-year-old boy has a crush on a girl and is shy around her. It makes it so a straight couple making out and grinding or even fade-to-black sex can be PG-13, but something like a character just even acknowledging he’s gay or heaven forbid holding hands or something obscene as kissing another guy makes it R-rated. \\n\\nI was saying to my (straight) best friend I would love to see an action movie like John Wick who happens to have/had a husband instead of a wife, then he was saying I just wanted to see guys making out and fucking. John Wick didn’t make out with anyone (maybe just a chaste kiss?) and there was no fucking, but we and everyone in the movie knows he’s straight just because he had a wife. If you just replace “wife” with “husband,” it wouldn’t change the movie or automatically make it more sexual or anything, but that’s how it’s seen. Deadpool (my favorite comic book character) is pretty much the only example of an action/superhero movie with a non-straight character, but pretty much every time he expresses something not-straight it’s for comedic effect (eg strap-ons, fondling Pullverine’s balls, grabbing Colossus’ ass) whereas he can talk about loving Vanessa in a serious way without it being comedic/sexual. However, that is true to DP’s character, so I don’t really *fault* him for being represented that way, but the issue is that he’s pretty much the only “representation” and that’s not being very representative. NSTW and Yukio in DP2 are a good example of LGBTQ+ representation who “happen to be” LGBTQ+, but like I said earlier their hand holding is limited to an R-rated movie... actually Once Upon a Deadpool was PG-13, so I guess that’s progress?\\n\\n/r <|reply|> This sort of thing is why I love the sci-fi show “The Expanse.” For example, around season 3 a lesbian couple becomes relevant to the story for reasons entirely unrelated to their sexuality, and the relationship is portrayed as loving and invested with the same joys and struggles as any other couple. They are never sexualized, and instead you see the way they handle more mundane and domestic concerns as a team. The show does similar stuff with race, religion, economic status—people are shown as people, who for the most part are complex personalities with a variety of talents and interests of their own. <|endoftext|>',\n",

To do this, they picked a few figures they didn\\'t like (Enki comes to mind), combined them, twisted them to being only evil influences (demons were originally spirts that provided inspiration, not that drive people to evil), named it/them according to their established stories, and condemned them all to hell.\\n\\nWhen fiction writers (notably, Dante) started exaggerating it and promoting the Devil to the master of all evil whom god triumphed over (but still apparently affects people all day every day despite \"losing\" to an omnipotent god)....no one really corrected them because it works well as a manipulation tactic. \\n\\nAnd because people don\\'t actually read religious documents.

Focusing on background noises that usually go unnoticed like the *tic-toc* of a clock, creaking floorboards or even the character\\'s own blood pumping in his ears can convey and enhance the feeling of anxiety the character is experiencing.\\n\\nThere\\'s probably something in your character\\'s backstory you can use as well, like, you know how his parents used to drop him off at his great aunt\\'s house on weekends? That great aunt who was overly fond of military-style discipline and had such high standards of a ten year old that he could never hope to live up to? Your character can spontaneously remember things like the sickening incense smell seeping out of her house as he approached it on Saturday mornings, which he can almost smell in his present anxiety-inducing situation. Who knows, he might even have a full on flashback which parallels his present situation.\\n\\nHope that helps. <|reply|> This is on the money. How your character reacts to situations is another. For example, you could have your character accidentally break a piece of furniture and get all bent out of shape. This shows aspects of their personality that speaks to what happens when they deal with other, larger problems and gives them a trait to learn about and overcome.  <|endoftext|>',\n",

That album is full of objectively bad music due to everything being in different keys and rhythms, the lyrics having no meaning, and having overall just a wildly abrasive sound.  However that was the goal of the band, and Captain Beefheart (the leader) drilled those songs into the members heads so fiercely that they can play this nearly impossible to perform music note for note.  Now, this album is considered one of the greatest ever, because it sought to be different, and perfected the art of being bad, making it truly so bad it’s good. \\n\\nOn the flip side if you get a bunch of novice musicians who barely know how to play their instruments, they can probably come up with something at least borderline similar, but they would never be able to replicate it and it would sound awful.\\n\\nThe difference is is that Captain Beefheart and His Magic Band knew what they were doing all along (and underneath the oddity of it all is actually technically proficient music).  But the band of novices tried to make something good, and in the process made something awful, and that I would say is objectively bad.\\n\\nThe same can be said about movies for example, (this is just one that I can think of) if you set out to make the next great drama, and it is full of terrible acting, an incoherent script, wonky camera work, and odd cgi, it’ll come off as laughably bad.  Take Tommy Wiseau’s The Room for example (arguably the worst movie ever made).  But if you set out to make a parody or satire on the drama genre, you can employ these very same characteristics and make something potentially great or hilarious.\\n\\nLet’s take a look at Tommy Wiseau again.  After The Room came out and everyone hated it, he tried to pass it off as a comedy in order to soften the blow.  He did this because people thought it was so bad that it’s funny, but if he said it’s a comedy now all of a sudden maybe it’s not so bad, maybe it’s bad on purpose, maybe it’s supposed to funny.

       " '<|endoftext|> To say that Harris is wrong is not correct.  Even this article does suggest that he is wrong. Only that at present we can not use his criteria alone to assess the morality of every possible situation. \\n\\nWhat Harris is suggesting is that since we are physical beings in a physical universe our actions have physical consequences. The impact of those consequences on the well being of others can be generally assessed.  It\\'s worth noting that Harris has acknowledged this limitation and suggested that it might be both a current technological barrier and a human comprehension one. \\n\\nLet\\'s look at the Harris Experiment proposed:\\n\\n10 people connected to a machine capable of causing different levels of pain. The scientist tells you that you must make a choice regarding the level of suffering the 10 people hooked up to the machine must endure. He gives you two options:\\n\\n1. One person experiences the greatest possible suffering for one hour and the nine others experience no suffering at all, after which all are released.\\n2. All ten people experience level 6 suffering for ten hours and are then released.\\n\\nIf you refuse to make the choice, all ten people receive level 10 suffering for ten hours.\\n\\nThis is presented as some sort of killer for a scientific approach. As if science could not be used to help make the most moral choice.  Let\\'s imagine the scientist allows you to conduct any experiments you want before you make the choice. AND let\\'s suppose you have access to highly advance equipment. \\n\\nYou could run an experiment on the pain threshold of the 10 participants. This would give you a better since of how \"level 10\" pain is experienced by each.  You could run experiments on the machine (How much worse is 10 than 6?) While this might not provide an answer, it\\'s  clear that this information will impact the assessment. \\n\\nSo yes, this doesn\\'t \"SOLVE\" the problem of all objective morality. But it supplies a baseline. <|reply|> Right, but very few would disagree that scientific investigation can aid moral decisions. Doesn\\'t Harris claim that he *has* solved the problem of objective morality by simply basing it on science?  <|endoftext|>',\n",

If done well everything can be enjoyable, even if it has been done a hundred times already.\\n\\nThat being said: \\n\\n1.Desert setting - If there hasn\\'t been a climate change, there is no reason why the world should be covered in a desert. Plants are pretty resistent, and it takes time for large masses of sand to form (only a small part of the world\\'s deserts are sand deserts).\\n\\n2.\"The whole world has been nuked\" - As much as I love criticism about nuclear bombs, the idea that basically all the land mass in the world, including sparsely populated regions have been hit by missiles is pretty absurd. Nukes are too expensive for that.\\n\\n3.Civilisation collapsed - In every post-apocalyptic setting the states have collapsed, people gave up their civilised life-style to live as bandits and fight in gang wars. Rarely a reason why they do is given, except \"everything\\'s gone to hell\". So the world has suffered great damage, but does that really mean all democracies die and there is absolutely no regular ecomomy anymore?\\n\\n4.Techological regression - Similar to the previous one.

The second paragraph has some confusing wording. You state that the main character would \"cling to any fleeting entanglement\". Which communicates that he would attach himself to women he barely knew, getting emotional with one night stands, but then the rest of the paragraph says he doesn\\'t even remember them. Consider changing this to something more along the lines of \"He would jump on any opportunity to forget his sorrows\" or something. Not clingy, just desperate for distraction or release.\\n\\n2. You gloss over a lot of details about how they met and how or why their relationship grew over time. There is dull phrasing like \"Learning about each other until they could say that they truly knew one another, like they had been friends for a lifetime.\" Describing what a newly dating couple does, but not how, or what was so interesting about each other. You may want to flesh out your characters more. Create backstories.\\n\\n3. Your main character is inconsistent, he\\'s clearly slept around a bit but seems to lack the confidence to establish himself in this woman\\'s life. Men who are experienced with women don\\'t usually hesitate to do certain actions that are clearly \"date like\". Drinks, dinners, walks in parks while dangerously close to eachother, and talking about relationships. Yes, he might be worried about screwing things up by taking her to bed too soon, but that wouldn\\'t stop him from doing things that communicated to her: \"Yes, I\\'m interested, but we\\'ll get to that later\"\\n\\n4. As a matter of fact, you stated they knew each other really well. Why is he lying in bed wondering if she\\'s seeing someone else? What are they talking endlessly about?\\n\\n5. More is brushed over about the kiss and the intimacy that follows. It\\'s clearly important what their relationship is, but it\\'s not so clear if that intimacy included going to bed with each other, which would be a crucial detail in the following \"what are we\" conversations. \\n\\n6. More is brushed over in those conversations. \"They laid everything bare\". Well, what was it? What did he want? What did she respond to his wants? Do they match up? Women usually love having \"what are we\" conversations. In fact, they\\'re usually the ones to initiate them if they\\'re interested in a guy but are unsure where they stand. \\n\\n7. It\\'s often said that this girl is perfect, but besides her brown hair and eyes I still know nothing about her. She\\'s litterally a blank slate in my mind at this point. You haven\\'t told us a single thing she has done besides hang out with this super needy guy. She isn\\'t even a character, just an object of his attention. And I say attention because we don\\'t even see him giving her affection. All they do is talk.\\n\\n8. Your ending seems like you wanted to build up to an emotional conclusion but it would have been a lot more impactful if we knew more about the characters involved. There is an element of conflict, the main character\\'s internal dilemma with his anxiety which tells him he will never be able to deserve this faceless yet perfect woman, but I was never invested in that conflict because it was summarized as if it was totally unimportant. \\n\\n9. I would have loved for more memories to flash through his mind before the final moment. As it stands it reinforces my statement about this girl being a blank placeholder. The only thing he has to remember her by is that first lock of hair. He doesn\\'t even have an icecream date to think about. Or a cute joke they shared. She\\'s totally faceless, just a lock of hair and some eyes floating in space.\\n\\n10. To summarize, the story was told, not shown.

Foreigner by C. J. Cherryh \\n\\nThis is a long running series about first contact between humans who have been lost in space and the alien Atevi. It deals heavily with court intrigue in a very alien setting, on a planet where humans are barely tolerated. Themes of alienation and isolation are explored through the eyes of Bren, the single human tolerated in Atevi society. The size of this series may be daunting but it is consistently fascinating.\\n\\n2. We Who Are About To... by Joanna Russ\\n\\nThis is a novella about a group of people who crash land on a barren planet. All the people in the group except the protagonist want to start a colony despite the obvious impossibility of it do to their population size and lack of resources. The protag runs away but is tracked down by the other people. What follows is a slew of murders and a wonderfully horrible, bleak ending. People hated this at the time it was written because it was too grim, but I adore it.\\n\\n3. Xenogenesis trilogy by Octavia Butler\\n\\nA trilogy about overly controlling aliens rescuing humans after a nuclear war renders our society a ruin. These books are hard to describe. Basically the aliens are gene collectors and they want to \"trade\" with humans, but how it plays out is consistently disturbing. It tends to go places you\\'d not like it not to.\\n\\n4. Ancillary Justice by Ann Leckie\\n\\nI think most people know what they think of this one already. Basically it follows a unique protagonist, who was formerly one of many brain dead soldiers in an army controlled by a warship AI, and who is now the only vestige of the ship itself after its destruction, as she goes on a quest to kill the person who destroyed her: the Empress of their civilization. Goes full weird, which I liked. The slow pace of the first third of the book pays off in the later chapters.\\n\\n5. Dark Orbit by Carolyn Ives Gilman\\n\\nI\\'m substituting the only man on my list in the other thread with this one. This is a first contact story where the \"alien\" society is a colony of humans who\\'ve gone blind from living in darkness. It follows the attempt to \"teach\" someone whose eyes never developed sight to use her vision, and a bizarre skill that the colonists have developed. This came out recently and I can\\'t recommend it enough, a mix of hard and soft scifi that somehow manages to be well grounded in its world building and downright strange in the places it goes at the same time.\\n\\nAlso I don\\'t know if there is interest in doing a top five dude-written scifi books as a companion thread to this one, but I\\'d be game if other people are interested.\\n <|reply|> > Dark Orbit by Carolyn Ives Gilman\\n\\nHer Twenty Worlds fiction is wonderful. \"Arkfall\" and [\"Umbernight\"](http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/gilman_02_18/) are such brilliantly imaginative stories with a Wow factor you don\\'t often get in sf nowadays. <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> > “More data & compute = SOTA” is NOT research news.\\n\\nI really hate this common refrain. \\n\\nIn virtually every other field, throwing more money at something *and showing it is actually helpful* is, in fact, a big deal.  It is not always clear, a priori, that doing so will be helpful; it only feels like a \"duh, obvious\" because we\\'re getting the result of a large search process which *includes* a lot of work to make sure that \"more data & compute\" does in fact work, from both an infrastructure POV and a theoretical POV (a whole set of once-common neural architectures exist that don\\'t appear to absorb data at scale to the same helpful degree).\\n\\nThe numbers for these experiments sound large (\"$250k\"), but really aren\\'t in the context of large aerospace experiments, biotechnology, etc., particularly when cross-referenced with salaries.  (Yes, I realize they are even higher with false starts, perhaps some hparam search, etc.).\\n\\nFurther, the results for these experiments have, to date, been made available *for free* to the ML research community.  There is tons of opportunity to build on top of literal giants (of spend).\\n\\nThere is a weird vein in ML where more compute and more data is somehow impure--best I can understand it, this comes from a combination of a subset of those with a deeper math / theoretical ML background who wish their large-scale systems would remain tractable for analysis, and a subset of the ML hacker crowd who wants SOTA to move forward on a laptop (and thus one small individual can always make a difference).  \\n\\n(Major disclaimer/clarification: I am not saying that everyone, or even most people, who fall into either of these two buckets feel this way!  Similarly, I am not saying that more theoretical or single-laptop work cannot move the field for in a helpful way at all.)\\n\\n> At the same time, the development of leaner models is dis-incentivized, as their task is fundamentally harder and the leaderboard-oriented community only rewards the SOTA. That, in its turn, prices out of competitions academic teams, which will not result in students becoming better engineers when they graduate.\\n\\nThis is a silly argument.  I mean, yeah, pick any field and as the price of participation goes toward zero, learning, competition, and advancement tends to increase.  But people still become drug developers, even though the fundamental cost to compete (trials at all stages) is incredibly high.  \\n\\nWe should do what we can to keep this price low (e.g., encourage and support open source, track and flag patent troll behaviors), but discouraging SOTA research is silly.  And ultimately, taken to its extreme--e.g., if some conferences would dismiss such papers as \"just engineering\", as some have suggested in the past--this makes it *harder* to participate in the community, because big companies will simply stop (under this scenario) sharing this sort of outcome/research, because the authors aren\\'t getting credit for it in the academic publishing community (which, funnily enough, is a core constraint on some of the largest companies in the world).\\n\\nIf someone is really concerned about this phenomenon, they should build a leaderboard for a *meaningful* set of tasks and constrain it to, e.g., exclude the use of outside data.  This exists in certain cases, but is fundamentally hard to do in a way that enables the forward movement of SOTA.  \\n\\nKaggle is, often, a very close example to this, and it often degenerates (from an academic POV) into feature- (and possibly p-) hacking.  \\n\\nSo maybe now you\\'ve got your leaderboard where you somehow wave away feature-hacking (which is rarely hyper generalizeable or universally informative).\\n\\nOK, well now take a look at SNLI and such before things like bert and elmo showed up: a lot of \"neural architecture hacking\", i.e., playing with architectures to 1) find something that seemed to conceptually very specifically aligned with the task at hand and 2) find something that just happens to work.  The truckload of neural architecture hacking papers on, say, SNLI will, I argue, generally had a small impact on moving the field forward (although iterations on attention did help support the build-out of Transformer).  And this is what you get when you constrain the problem space.  (Plus the very top-end SNLI papers tended to often throw de facto feature engineering in there too.)\\n\\nNow, can you still design a leaderboard and a competition in a way to still be interesting, with data-sparse as a requirement?  Sure.  I don\\'t mean to say this is an impossible goal.  But it is actually fairly difficult, based on history on how such leaderboards are used, and how their usage does or doesn\\'t move SOTA forward.  Further, there are plenty of things that look good at a smaller scale, but don\\'t scale up (i.e., add value; features are a common example) to larger data scenarios.  \\n\\nWhich takes us full circle, back to acknowledging that more data+more compute=better results is NOT a foregone conclusion. <|reply|> >“More data & compute = SOTA” is NOT research news.  \\n>  \\n>I really hate this common refrain.\\n\\nRespectfully, I think you\\'re missing the point there. From the following passage in the original post, I think the author isn\\'t saying \"More data & compute = SOTA\" is categorically bad:\\n\\n>Furthermore, much of this research is not reproducible: nobody is going  to spend $250,000 just to repeat XLNet training. Given the fact that its  ablation study showed only 1-2% gain over BERT in 3 datasets out of 4,  we don’t actually know for sure that its masking strategy is more  successful than BERT’s.\\n\\nI think their point is that currently, \"More data & compute = SOTA\" in the absence of such resources affordable to non-corporate entities, together with all the ramifications as it pertains to the scientific method (such as barrier to aforementioned reproducibility), makes this \"NOT research news\" in the academic sense of the phrase. <|endoftext|>',\n",

I have a few critiques:\\n\\n* In the beginning, you don\\'t have to clarify that Sal is his name. She\\'s addressing him, so the reader already knows it. There are other ways you can show that he\\'s used multiple names over time, rather than having him state it like this.\\n\\n* The paragraph starting with \"My parents had money\" seems pretty unnatural. People don\\'t speak like that, and it comes off as an awkward information dump. Even just having him think that rather than say it would sound better. Also, you used \"kissed me on the head after breakfast\" twice there, I\\'m not sure if it was on purpose.\\n\\n* Your character is cynical, but he still needs some reason to be rude to people. People generally don\\'t think they\\'re the bad guy, and your character would be even more interesting and realistic if he didn\\'t completely acknowledge that he\\'s terrible. I don\\'t think him saying \"fucking\" to an old lady would be that shocking to her, and I don\\'t see his intention in saying that to a couple. Narcissists think they\\'re right all the time and probably wouldn\\'t admit that they just do things to be shitty people. If he was in denial of the fact that he\\'s this cynical even if it\\'s blatantly obvious to the reader, he would come across as even more realistic and dislikeable.\\n\\n* I don\\'t think you need so many parentheses. All the times you use them here aren\\'t necessary IMO, and seeing them takes me out of the story a bit. \\n\\nThese are just some things that stood out to me as a reader. You definitely should keep writing in this genre, but making some of these changes, especially about how the main character views himself, would add to the dirty and rough tone and make it more believable.  <|endoftext|>',\n",

       " '<|endoftext|> The real question you need to answer (and be really honest about) is the question of what do you REALLY want to do?\\n\\nWhen you say \"research\", do you mean fundamental research (e.g. \"what does th error surface of a neural network look like?\"), applied research (\"can I use deep learning to solve problem $X?\"), product development (\"how exactly do I implement a semantic segmentation CNN to recognize pedestrians in my car\") or do you just want to get into this area because it\\'s hip/well payed and don\\'t really care about the contents?\\n\\nI\\'ve asked these questions in decreasing likelihood of needing a PhD. Let\\'s go through them step by step:\\n\\nIn my experience, industry AI research labs that do fundamental research (especially the ones you apparently want to get into, like Deepmind, Google Brain or Facebook AI Research) hire *scientists*. Having a Master\\'s degree or two (or consulting experience) doesn\\'t make you into a scientist. Because that\\'s what a PhD is for: to teach you how to be a scientist. Your consultancy will not mean much, because when you\\'re consulting, you don\\'t need science skills. Sure, you need analytical skills and you need to know how to apply existing methods, but that is not what DOING SCIENCE means. You have to learn to ask the right questions (Step 1), know how to approach that question scientifically (Step 2) and then, work hard until you have your solution (step 3) and then analyze that solution (step 4) and maybe communicate those results (step 5). More than likely, right now you only know how to do step 3 (and 5), because up to Master\\'s level, that\\'s what university education mainly focuses on, in my experience (YMMV, I haven\\'t met many French ppl). \\nSo it\\'s no wonder the big labs aren\\'t interested in hiring you as a scientist, because from your CV, it\\'s apparent that you are not a scientist. \\n\\nGo and look at the papers of the *top* conferences, where the labs you want to get into actually publish. Are you, right now, consistently capable of producing research like that? I don\\'t mean just understanding those papers and being able to re-implement them. You hopefully are able to do that. But would you be able to come up with solutions like that? Would you even think of trying to solve problems like this one? Would you be able to come up with the math/proofs required to show the theoretical background, would you know how the stuff is connected to all the other stuff currently being researched (so you know what else to cite)? Because those are the skills that scientists have.\\n\\nAnd if you really do already know how to do all of that stuff, then your CV should clearly reflect that: Where are the papers at top conferences that you authored yourself? Everything else barely matters for true research positions.\\n\\nNow, the thing is that there are still fewer scientists than there are open positions for ML scientists. And even among people with PhD, there\\'s a wide range of quality differences. So research labs DO actually hire some scientists-to-be, as long as they\\'re very promising. Some even collaborate with some universities so they can snag promising talents from there, or have programs to produce their own new scientists (e.g. in residency programs). But you\\'ll still need to show that you are able to do science (or will potentially be in the future) . I don\\'t think having a Master\\'s and some Consultancy job are enough to show that you have promise as a scientist. Having a paper at a *good* conference does that. If you\\'re just an MSc, even a mediocre conference or a workshop is a good indicator. At the very least, find an reputable reseracher who can vouch for you. But IMO, doing a PhD is your very best option if you want to do fundamental research.\\n\\nIf instead of fundamental research you want to do applied research, the game gets a little easier, because it\\'s easier to get your foot in the door in an applied field (I think). The bar of entry is a bit lower, I think, because simply knowing the applied field will get you far. It\\'s also easier to move laterally (e.g. from the software developer that writes the front end to ML engineer that implements the algorithms in the backend to the applied researcher who actually develops the algorithms). \\n\\nFor both kinds of research, the PhD is not the only way to entry, albeit the most common. Of course you can write blogs, re-implement stuff and have side projects on github for that kind of stuff (since a lot of it is applying existing science to new problems), and that\\'s a good way to show people you\\'re a motivated, interested and capable person.  Especially for people with good analytical skills. But still, if research is your end goal (no matter if applied or not), a PhD is the usual career path choice. And with how the field is growing, it\\'s likely to only get harder to get into the field without the proper education ( = without doing a PhD).\\n\\nLastly, if you want to do development, I think you should have no problem getting a job with your current skill set.\\n\\n\\nHowever, the main question that puzzles me: if you really want to do RESEARCH, why aren\\'t you doing a PhD already? Because that\\'s pretty much exactly what a PhD does day-in, day-out. You don\\'t need to work at Google to do cool AI stuff. Most of the very cool research in the field is done in academia by PhD students! (after you finish your PhD, it should be no problem to move into an industry research position for more money)\\n\\nDisclaimer: this is just my personal opinion & experience. YMMV.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR: if you want to do research, start by doing a PhD\\n\\n\\nEDIT: a lot of people have contacted me and are worried because they might not be \"good enough at math/proofs\" to do a PhD. Don\\'t sweat it! You\\'re supposed to learn on the job, and a solid grasp of undergrad math will get you a long way. No-one expects you to be a math whiz. It\\'s true, ML is an analytical field were we\\'re trying to find well-founded answers using math, but enthusiasm and curiosity about the field is all you need. The rest will come with time. What I talked about in this post is what I personally expect an ML research scientist to be able to do AFTER having completed a PhD, not before (and of course, not everyone has to research super math-heavy stuff, there\\'s plenty of interesting topics in ML that don\\'t require pages and pages of proofs). <|reply|> This answer is gold for undecided MSc students.\\n\\nI\\'d like to know your thoughts on how to get the maths skill level to \"come up with the math/proofs required to show the theoretical background\", if one comes from say, a plain old CS background or a little lower?\\n\\nI have to mention tho, that I\\'m brushing off/learning some algebra and bayesian stats in the masters. <|endoftext|>',\n",
