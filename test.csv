33,"I see a split vision of the future.  Politics has never mattered more.  Our technology will either help us or oppress us depending on how data rights are set up in the near future.  Shifting gears; I think the decarbonization of energy will continue along with AI becoming a more common tool for everything imaginable.  From table reservations at restaurants to SDV's, military, medicine, and law enforcement.  I think the real game changer will be humanoid, robotic, police walking beats.  That's when the rubber will hit the road - a cop who will always be right no matter what.  Could be good or a hell where the letter of the law could be enforced with such finality that people would be walking around on eggshells.  UBI would be the recipe for stability, but current outmoded capitalist ideals still seem to be the go-to for those with power.  Capitalism is like a story, it has a beginning and end.  We're seeing laissez faire's death throws now.  Capitalism can only survive on life support offered by socialism.  They should not be thought of as discrete systems, but complimentary gears in the same machine.  In fact capitalism, when left to its own devices, simply destroys itself turning into feudalism and oligarchy.  The balances between the haves and have not's must be kept within a certain boundary to maintain a relatively free society and that balance is democratic socialism.  UBI is the current manifestation.  I see property close to high tide zones becoming less desirable and landlocked properties far, far inland also looking bad as global warming raises seas and increases inland continental temperatures to the point where crops and even soil bacteria, like in the midwest US, will not be able to survive heat waves.  These heat waves will be beyond what we see now that measure 105F to 110F+.  They will likely be 110+ to 120+, thus effectively rendering large areas of inland America unsuitable for agriculture barring technological advances of course.  Even if we could turn off carbon production now, these things would likely still happen.  Humanity took a long walk on a short dock and we'll see if we can recover.

One of the more telling character moments is when he sits down in a restaurant for a meal and really does nothing out of the ordinary except torch the bill at the end with his heat vision.  He is a god who is aware of the fact that he is a god, and even when doing heroic things he holds himself as an existence separate from humanity.  Too often writers try to go all edgy and use the rejection of literary and societal expectations as an opportunity to tear everything down, but what is different is not necessarily a negation.  Ennis with the *Boys* is a good example of this nihilistic tendency, and  Veitch's *Brat Pack* took this to the level of exploitation by making superheroes into pedophiles and sidekicks their victims.  Hyperion never went down this route.

You mentioned that there will be less effort in writing a graphic novel and I'm not so certain that's true, especially if you aren't the one drawing the book.

Alan Moore supposedly writes enormous novel length scripts for his graphic novels. It is a different kind of writing, but I don't know that it's easier. For example, when writing prose, you ought not to dump a ton of exposition all at once, where you might be able to get away with that in a graphic novel because you're just telling the artist.

The story of what it means to be human, the neo-noir tone and feel, the contrast of a vibrant, Japanese infused, high tech society compared to the stark, cold and blocky corporate buildings subsiding within LA that control everything.. and last but not least, young Harrison Ford being a bad ass sleuth. In the Directors Cut, you can really feel the underlying ambiguity of whether Deckard is a human or replicant himself. And the ending is left more open to interpretation than other cuts of the film which I really liked. Everything was so seamlessly integrated into one believable and cohesive narrative that captivated me. But don’t get me wrong, I loved Blade Runner 2049 too.

As the MC he hates fighting, confrontation, violence, and will most definitely never kill anyone. The anticipation of this clash is the drive of his character's inner conflict and development. But in the end he still has to face the decision to kill Ozai when he defeats him. His solution is to learn how to remove Ozai's supernatural powers through a forgotten art, making him mostly harmless and emotionally destroying his ego. Aang gets to retain his moral high ground while still preventing further suffering and horrible things to happen.

There's a point where descriptive language, like your repetiton of how cold the water is, makes the story less coherent instead of more. One thing I would say is to lead your reader straight to the point of your story and not dally around in heavily layered description. Read through a couple times and every word that is a synonym for an earlier adjective should be cut. With metaphors and similes, like the prison of water she is trapped in, the meaning can again be obscured by too much description. Your story has a message; try to write towards it with as much pacing as the story needs, and cut out any excess words or sentences. While the language was awkward, that will improve over time the more you write. It's a great idea and I thought the ending was a nice inversion of what I was expecting. Anyway, just my two cents",[0]

With Luke Skywalker, he flew, but he needed training in lightsaber combat, and using the force. He didn’t use his lightsaber until return of the Jedi, and lost the battle at the end. Rey won a battle against a highly trained lightsaber combatant. Ghostbusters (2016) flopped because it pandered to women only, and lost the interest of over half the ghostbusters fans (Men 51%, Women 49%) and then proceeded to blame their failure on sexism, when it was their fault entirely. On that note though, Ocean’s Eight was a high quality film that didn’t pander to one specific audience.

Mostly in prose, dialogue connects the reader to the world in a relatable way, we speak so do characters. Characters can't read each others minds like we do as a reader so characters need to share with each other.

At a few points I wanted them to get on with the story rather than beat around the bush with one another. I do think Malik's call to action with his new child coming is a good one, however it can feel more powerful. Even though at the end of the prologue Malik mention's that he is worried about the financial ramifications of having a child, it doesn't sound desperate enough to go on a voyage that he is vehemently against. For me as a reader I like my pacing a little faster and have the stakes a little bigger. I may not be the type of audience you are writing for so take it with a grain of salt.

This is one way to write extremely clever people where you might not be as clever. It also helps that as the author, you KNOW the answer of the puzzle your characters is trying to solve.

The story was initially soothing with the descriptors that gave it a very classic fantasy feeling that I really enjoyed. There were a few choices that I would like to bring up though. After the prologue there was a little exposition dump. While I enjoyed the lore I felt as if it could have been introduced periodically throughout the text in places where it was most important or relevant.

12023,"That's not what that's about. Any author basing their books on their own personal ideology is very likely writing a lot of bad books. But the question was about themes, and odds are that if you're eschewing them, your characters and plots are somewhat directionless. For example, (and this is quite possibly the only time in my life I will ever use this show as a good example of anything), even Seinfeld couldn't entirely escape themes. As directionless as the show was, just the relationships between the various characters provided a theme of friendship. Themes very often are simply explorations of certain concepts and the ways in which they can impact a character's life. I would argue that quite possibly the strongest themes in LotR were friendship and loyalty. Frodo could never have gotten even beyond the first human village if not for his friendship with Gandalf. That friendship told him where to look for help, and the loyalty of that friend to Gandalf is what made him help a handful of total strangers. You see things like that over and over throughout the series. And you'll notice that Tolkien didn't shy away from showing that friendship can make you vulnerable either. Just look at all the places where supposed friends betrayed the group, or those who would try to help them. Themes aren't necessary, but they do help tie things together, and if we're being honest, they're pretty much entirely unavoidable. To illustrate: a character refuses to learn from their mistakes. Their theme: hardheadedness. They keep making one specific mistake, such as going back to a toxic ex: weakness, or love (not necessarily the same thing). They learn from their mistakes: growth. We can go on and on down the list but I think that makes my point. Even if you try to avoid themes entirely, they still creep in to some extent, simply because there are a limited number of things a given character can do and still be a coherent character. They will encounter loosely related events with every character in the story, simply because of their relationship to that character. Even if you make every single other character in your story a one-and-done character, there's themes of always being a stranger, or loneliness, or solitude. If you think you can really avoid themes, just st",[0]

They mainly taught Ethics since they said the rest is mostly for when we’re older. We learned about Aristotle’s Virtue Ethics, Kant Categorical Imperative, Utilitarianism,and countless others.
